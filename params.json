I'm worked on a Project that contains: Playing racing games with a Smartphone!\r\nIt gives you the possibility to controll the car, completly from smartphone. Accelerate, Brake, Shift up/down, handbrake and more...\r\n\r\n### Programming \r\nIt was completly programmed with Python, it's also Cross Platform\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nI tested it with different racing games! Live for Speed, Vdrift and torcs. But you can use it, with all racing games that gives you the possibility, to control it with the mouse. \r\n\r\n## Principle and operation of the program\r\nIt runs over Client/Server. You install the client on your Phone (Nokia N900) and the server on the PC.\r\n![Principle](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/28896521/prinzip.png)\r\nStart the Server from PC. If the Game begins, connect to the server and it runs.\r\n\r\n## Future\r\nI developing an Tray programm and a setup programm. That you need only a install file.\r\nAnd i'am working on a Android Version.
